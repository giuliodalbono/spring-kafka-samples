# Spring Kafka Sample Applications

This repository contains a collection of applications using Spring for Apache Kafka or
Spring Cloud Stream Kafka.

Each application is self contained and have its `docker-compose.yml` file which in
combination with `spring-boot-docker-compose` allow you to just run it having a Docker
instance running.
